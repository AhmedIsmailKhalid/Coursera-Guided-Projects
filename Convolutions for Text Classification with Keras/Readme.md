# In this Guided Project, you will:
- [x] Apply Word Embeddings for Text Classification

- [X] Use 1D Convolutions as Feature Extractors for Text in NLP

- [X] Perform Binary Text Classification using Deep Learning with Keras

<br/><br/>

Welcome to this hands-on, guided introduction to Text Classification using 1D Convolutions with Keras. By the end of this project, you will be able to apply word embeddings for text classification, use 1D convolutions as feature extractors in natural language processing (NLP), and perform binary text classification using deep learning. 

As a case study, we will work on classifying a large number of Wikipedia comments as being either toxic or not (i.e. comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). This issue is especially important, given the conversations the global community and tech companies are having on content moderation, online harassment, and inclusivity. The data set we will use comes from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle. 

To complete this guided project, we recommend that you have prior experience in Python programming, deep learning theory, and have used either Tensorflow or Keras to build deep learning models. We assume you have this foundational knowledge and want to learn how to use convolutions in NLP tasks such as classification.
