# In this Guided Project, you will:
- [x] Build interactive data dashboards with Streamlit and Python

- [x] Use Pandas for data manipulation in data science workflows

- [x] Create interactive plots with Plotly Python

<br/><br/>

Welcome to this hands-on project on building your first interactive, data dashboard with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, you are going to be comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive dashboards and web apps, all with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 150 lines of Python code!

Prior experience with writing simple Python scripts and using pandas for data manipulation is recommended.
