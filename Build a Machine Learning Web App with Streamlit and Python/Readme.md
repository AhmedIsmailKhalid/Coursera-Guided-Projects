# In this Guided Project, you will:
- [x] Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python

- [x] Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn

- [x] Plot evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms

<br/><br/>

Welcome to this hands-on project on building your first machine learning web app with the Streamlit library in Python. By the end of this project, you are going to be comfortable with using Python and Streamlit to build beautiful and interactive ML web apps with zero web development experience! We are going to load, explore, visualize and interact with data, and generate dashboards in less than 100 lines of Python code! Our web application will allows users to choose what classification algorithm they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values, all without them knowing to code!

Prior experience with writing simple Python scripts and using pandas for data manipulation is recommended. It is required that you have an understanding of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifiers and how to use them in scikit-learn.
